Stupid and very bad webscraping of [Ultimate Frame Data](https://ultimateframedata.com/) to get the frame data & stats of all characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. 
The data is then stored in a SQLite Database.

Very likely to break in the near future.

Also, since the data is very inconsistent, manual corrections are needed.
